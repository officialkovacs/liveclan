# Ninja Saga &middot; Live Clan Ranking

### How to use it?
  1. Place all files into your hosting.
  1. Open **updateJson.html** (only in your vps) to update json/clan.json data.
  1. Open ranking page and Enjoy!

---

### Information
**updateJson.html** should only be opened by hosting owner since it updates the clan ranking data serverside, so everyone else who is using live clan ranking will not need to open that page to view updated clan information because they are already receiving the updated json/clan.json data that hosting owner is constantly updating.
